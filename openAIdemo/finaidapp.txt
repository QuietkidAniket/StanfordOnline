I am currently a college freshman who has enrolled into a private institution for studying computer science. Now due to limited financial ability, my father has to take up education loans for the whole course of study of 4 years at the university because it is really expensive. On top of that he is paying a lot for my food and rent which is almost 1/3rd of his salary. Morally and emotionally I am obligated in restraining myself from putting any further financial burden on my hardworking father, so I really want some financial aid from your side so that I can complete the prestigious course with being awarded a completion certificate at the end. The experience is what I really seek and the certificate will be an ornament of my hard work on industrial and social arena. I also assure you that I am a hardworking student, and would be putting this aid in good use with the best of intentions - towards my academic  career. Thanking you in anticipation.

 Generative AI is currently a very trending topic in the industry and the academic forums and I want to update my skillset to stay up to date with my peers as well as the industrial standards. This course is expected to give me an insight into a field I have never delved into. I believe including a powerful tool like Generative AI will immensely help in aiding our daily lives and solve existing problems to the degree we may have not imagine yet. Correct usage of this powerful technology is hence my current objective. Having such a powerful technology in my bag of skills, I can delve further into Natural Language Processing, Deep learning, usage of Generative AI in medicine sciences, software research and an endless list of interests. Also I might take up on some research topics in Generative AI as one of my later academic endeavours.
